Design Complicated CNN model and Cloud photos to train and test.

Project objectives
Use publicly available data set for classification problem â€‹https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data 
1) Make a complicated Sequential and multi-combined parallel CNNs modes. Each layer also combines Batchnorm and Scale layer, plus more layers. 
2) Input dimension is (3,224,224). Freeze the model and provide .pb, .pbtxt, then comparing Quantization(light) with Full.
3) Tiering cache memory
